# Comparing-How-Socioeconomic-Factors-Influence-Alcohol-Consumption-Rates-Between-Countries

Within this report we will investigate how various socioeconomic factors influences the alcohol consumption
rates of countries around the world and compare between the eastern and western hemispheres. We will be
using data that was collected by reputable agencies such as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,
the US Census Bureauâ€™s International Database, the United Nations Statistics Division, and the World Bank.
We used this data in a post stratification method in order to make casual inferences about the connection
between socioeconomic factors and alcoholic consumption despite being observational data. By calculating the
propensity score using a linear logistic regression we are able to match observations based on their likelihood
of being in the treatment groups by using nearest neighbor matching. With a new dataset of only matched
observations we are able to investigate the alcohol consumption rates between countries and compare. Using
this method we found that between eastern and western hemisphere the drinking rates were relatively similar
with the eastern hemisphere countries being a lot more varied compared to the western hemisphere. This is
mainly due to the fact that the eastern hemisphere has a lot more countries in it and it contains countries
widely varying in their alcoholic consumption rates and socioeconomic conditions. This variation led to the
eastern hemisphere having both the highest and lowest rates of alcohol consumption.
